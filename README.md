### Project 1: Personal Blog Website

For this project, we used our knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a personal blog from scratch. Our submission was submitted and was evaluated for a number of critieria relating to the content and HTML and CSS markup. In the interest of time, I kept things relatively simple. I'll share more about my process as the project goes on.
